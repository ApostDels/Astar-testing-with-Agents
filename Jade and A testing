Made a program using jade framework and A* algorithm for pathfinding. The idea behind A* is to create a list and compare the costs of each path in order to find the most optimal. Jade is an agent creator which includes a gui in it. Jade has a range of behaviours and actions available for us to use in our agents. I also use jade in order to have a communication system between the agent and the environment. I'd only use the Cyclic behaviour from the available behaviours Jade has. Unfortunately the program remains unfinished. Jade seems to not work with my constructors. The A* algorithm works perfectly fine, and the methods are also good.
